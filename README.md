# Pathfinding

This library contains generic implementations of A* pathfinding and Dijkstra maps.  The library has several key features:

* Can easily be adapted for any graph or grid structure used in most games.
* Supports terrain costs and non-walkable terrain.
* Dijkstra maps can perform quick pathfanding searches for multiple sources and targets.
